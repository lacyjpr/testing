# Udacity FEND P6: Feed Reader Testing

This project demonstrates the use of the Jasmine framework for JavaScript Testing using the vehicle of a completed feed reader.

## Installation and use

Clone the repository to your machine or click "download zip" and unzip the files to your computer. Double click the index.html file. You'll see a feed reader application with the results of my Jasmine tests at the bottom of the page.

Alternatively, point your browser to http://lacyjpr.github.io/testing/ to see a live version of the project.
